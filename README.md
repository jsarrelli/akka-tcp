# The Scala Homework Problem

This homework problem is written to be challenging. There might be terms or
systems you are unfamiliar with in this problem but that's okay. What
we're interested in is *how* you tackle and solve problems, especially problems
you haven't seen before. This problem might require some research and certainly
some questions and clarification from us. Please don't get stuck! If you get
stuck, just let me know and I'll be more than happy to provide help of any
kind. Not everyone we've hired has completely solved this problem!

### Problem: write a generic TCP relay.

Suppose you have two programs that can talk to a relay computer via TCP, but
can not reach each other (because of NAT or firewall issues).

### You are asked to:

1. Implement a relay server program. We will run this program on the relay
   computer that the other programs *can* talk to. This program will listen
   for TCP connections on behalf of other programs, alert the other programs
   when an incoming connection has been made, and forward all
   incoming/outgoing traffic from the incoming connection to the other program
   and vice versa, regardless of application protocol (so, this is a level
   lower than HTTP or SSL or something). The relay server program will be
   contacted by two types of applications - programs needing a relay and
   other programs wanting to talk to the program needing a relay.
2. Describe in clear terms to another programmer how they would enable a
   program they already have, behind some firewall, to be able to use your
   relay server. Remember that every program in this scenario can contact the
   relay server, but the relay server can't *initiate* communication with any
   other program (due to firewalls, etc).
3. To help yourself debug and for us to evaluate your work, write a small
   application that uses the relay server (maybe an echo server). Once your
   server has established a successfully relayed port, it should output
   hat its new public address is, and we should be able to contact it,
   through the relay, with existing programs like telnet or netcat or
   something. Note that this requires your relay server interface to notify
   relayed clients of their public address.
4. Your relay server should work generally for any application level protocol
   (not just the echo server), for multiple concurrent clients, where each
   client may have its own multiple concurrent clients.

Use the scala programming language and tools you feel most comfortable with, though we
ask that you try to limit yourself to standard libraries where possible.

In order to test this, make sure that your relay program can be started on the
command line:

```
./relay port
```

where port is the port the relay listens on, and how your echoserver will
contact the relay. You can (and probably should) accept other arguments, but
choose reasonable defaults.

Your echo server program should be started on the command line:

```
./echoserver relayhost relayport
```

where relayhost is the host the relay is running on, and port is the port you
provided to the relay program. Upon receiving a (host, port) pair from the
relay, the echo server program should notify us what its relayed hostname/port
pair is.

### Example session:

```
$ ./relay 8080 &
$ ./echoserver localhost 8080 &
established relay address: localhost:8081
$ telnet localhost 8081
Hello, world
Hello, world
```

Thanks, and good luck!



# Solution

Solution was built using Akka Http modules.

### Steps to build the project
```
sh ./build_jars.sh
```
This command builds two jars for the two modules of the project.
 - Echo Server
 - Relay Server

### Steps to run application
```
sh ./relay.sh {?port}
sh ./echoserver.sh {?host} {?port}
established relay address: localhost:8081
$ telnet localhost 8081
Hello, world
Hello, world
```
